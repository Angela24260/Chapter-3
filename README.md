# Chapter-3: Learning Dart Basics
### What I Learned:
This chapter was a deep dive into Dart, the programming language that powers Flutter. I started with an introduction to Dart's syntax, focusing on its clean and concise structure, which is ideal for building modern applications. I learned how to define variables, use different data types like int, double, String, and bool, and explored Dartâ€™s type inference system with var and dynamic.

Understanding control structures such as if statements, loops (for, while, do-while), and switch cases enabled me to write logical, decision-based code. I also explored functions in Dart, including how to define, call, and pass arguments (positional, named, and default). Collections like lists, sets, and maps were introduced, showing me how to store and manipulate data efficiently. Additionally, I learned the importance of error handling using try-catch blocks to make my code robust and reliable.

### Achievement:
To apply my newfound knowledge, I built a console-based calculator app that performed basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project helped me understand how to structure a Dart program, handle user inputs, and process logic effectively. Writing a functional application using only Dart basics reinforced my confidence in the language.
